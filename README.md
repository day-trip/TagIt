# TagIt
The quickest way to keep track of your stuff

## Inspiration
People lose their items every day. Ranging from water bottles to car keys, keeping track of all your items can be difficult. Especially at school, lost items are often found, but are difficult to return to the owner. This inspired us to built TagIt, a simple and modern service based on QR codes for keeping track of items.

## What it does
TagIt allows you to generate QR codes to stick on your items. If found, people can get in touch with you by scanning the code. If you would like to remain anonymous, people will instead be prompted to enter where you should go to reclaim your item.

## How we built it
We built TagIt using NextJS 14 (React), Amazon Web Services, and TailwindCSS. We use server actions and localStorage for handling data.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was making a simple, modern, and clean looking UI in the limited time.

## What's next for TagIt
We plan to extend TagIt into a full service with geographical data and AI image embeddings.
